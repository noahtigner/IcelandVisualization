I made a visualization of Iceland. I chose Iceland because it is geographically dramatic, 
and is also my favorite place that I have visited.
The movie includes the topography, information on rivers, 
waterfalls, rivers, etc, and the centers of population. Much of the data I used came as shapefiles, 
which are 2 dimensional. To map them to 3D space, I scaled their Z axis by the height data provided by
the Digital Elevation Model (DEM). I did the same for the Populated Areas data, which represents data as cells (a raster).

In order, the movie shows:
    - the Isorhythmic Contour Map (topgraphic map), made with isolines
    - the Base Map, based on the Digital Elevation Model
    - the waterways (polylines)
    - the roads (polylines)
    - the population centers (raster cells)
    - some fancy transitions

I used VisIt, and wrote a script in Python to automate things. I also used FFMPeg.

I had considerable difficulty making this visualization. First, it was more difficult than I anticipated to 
find relatively small datasets for the island. I needed a DEM that matched exactly with the x and y coordinated of the shapefiles and raster files.
Mapping and scaling these together is trivial in ArcGIS but much more difficult otherwise. I lost an entire days worth of work when VisIt started crashing my computer 
every time I ran it. The only solution was to reinstall and start fresh. I also ran into problems with the window being a blank screen and not
displaying any data (however the screen captures would work). I also had issues with attribute changes being applied 
to the wrong plot/layer, even with the correct settings set. Despite these issues, I am very proud of the movie I created.
